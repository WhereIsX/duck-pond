# Intro && Background
This project started as a way to learn [three.js](https://threejs.org).  Currently, we (YANA & some duckies) want to use threejs to make a duck pond as a brb page <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> / setting-up-stream page <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>  
The rendered room would animate geometric shapes (ducks) to represent
the number of people (duckies) in the twitch channel.  May need to dig into integrating with YANAs irc-based twitch chat bot to instance duckies in the room.

**duck pond is still a work in process**

# Ideas
- moscoww:
  - !feed the ducks
- steve:
  - instancing
  - water effects
- tonewexp:
  - earn channel points to feed!
    - (ducks may die?)
- YANA:
  - zombie ducks if they die!
- tonewexp:
  - spend NANDS(channel points) to get a zombied duck?
